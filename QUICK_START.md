## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Page shows directory listing instead of website
**Solution:** Rename `index.html` to ensure it's the default page, or check your hosting's default document settings.

### Issue: Drone course page shows 404 error
**Solution:** Ensure `drone-course.html` is in the same directory as `index.html` (usually `public_html` or root).

### Issue: Styles not loading (page looks plain)
**Solution:** Verify `styles.css` is uploaded and in the same directory. Clear your browser cache.

### Issue: JavaScript features not working
**Solution:** Check that both `script.js` and `drone-course-detail.js` are uploaded. Open browser console (F12) to check for errors.

### Issue: Links not working
**Solution:** Ensure all files are in the same directory. Check that file names match exactly (case-sensitive on some servers).

## Customization Quick Tips

### Change Site Title
Edit the `<title>` tag in `index.html` and `drone-course.html`:
```html
<title>Your Academy Name - Master Business Fundamentals</title>
```

### Change Colors
Edit the CSS variables in `styles.css`:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #4F46E5;  /* Change this */
    --secondary-color: #F59E0B;  /* And this */
}
```

### Add Your Logo
Replace `favicon.ico` with your logo file (keep the same name).

### Update Contact Info
Search for "Contact" in `index.html` and update the email/phone.

## Performance Tips

### For Better Speed
1. Enable GZIP compression in your hosting control panel
2. Use a CDN (Cloudflare is free and easy)
3. Enable browser caching
4. Consider minifying CSS and JS files
